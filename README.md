## FoundationPose Execution Guide

This page provides a guide to running the **FoundationPose** model easily and summarizes potential issues that may arise. Hope this helps!

It is assumed that the **[official FoundationPose repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/FoundationPose)** has already been set up, including the Docker configuration and weight files.

## üìÇ Required Data for Model-based Execution

To run this model using the **Model-based (CAD model available) approach**, you need to prepare the following five types of data.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ RGB & Depth
- **RGB Image**: Standard RGB images in `.png` format, saved with matching timestamps.
- **Depth Image**: Corresponding depth images with the same timestamps as the RGB images.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- I tested with an **800√ó800** resolution dataset.  
  For reference, When running with **1920√ó1080** resolution, even an **RTX 3090** experienced memory issues(24GB). 
- The script `data_saver.py` can be used to **subscribe to ROS topics** and save RGB and Depth images in the specified directory.
- The topic names depend on the sensor you are using, and you should adjust the save path accordingly.
- **The RGB and depth images must have identical filenames and timestamps.**


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mask

Once the **RGB and Depth images** are prepared, a **mask** is required. 

- If you intend to use the model in real-time, masks can be obtained through other methods.
- However, in this model, **pose estimation is performed only for the first scene**, and the system switches to **tracking mode** afterward.
- Therefore, you only need to generate a mask for the **first frame**.

#### How to Create a Mask
- You can use your own **segmentation model** to generate masks and save them as shown in the example image.
- Alternatively, you can manually create masks using the `masking.py` script provided in this repository.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Ensure that the saved **image path** matches the expected directory structure for the model.
